This tool allows you to quickly run your Cloud Build configuration against multiple machine types in parallel. 

Once the jobs are complete you get a read out of the time each took and how much they cost.

## Quick Start

This repo includes and example `cloudbuild.yaml` that compiles the Linux kernel. 
Below are the steps to test out that configuration across the available Cloud Build machine types.

1. Clone this repo and change directories to the `example` folder:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/viglesiasce/cloudbuild-optimizer
    cd cloudbuild-optimizer/example
    ```

1. Download the latest release:

    ```shell
    curl -L "https://github.com/viglesiasce/cloudbuild-optimizer/releases/download/v0.2.0/cloudbuild-optimizer_0.2.0_$(uname)_$(uname -m)" -o cloudbuild-optimizer
    chmod +x cloudbuild-optimizer
    ```

1. Run the tool.

    ```shell
    $ ./cloudbuild-optmizer
    ```

    You should see output as follows:
    
    ```shell
    View your builds here: https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds
